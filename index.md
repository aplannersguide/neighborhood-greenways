# Welcome to the Neighborhood Greenways Project!

Our mission is to help communities create safe, pleasant routes for walking, biking, and connecting with neighbors by transforming low-traffic residential streets into **Neighborhood Greenways** (also known as Bike Boulevards).

This website provides resources, information, and ways to get involved:

* **Project Details:** Learn more about the overall vision.
* **The Playbook:** A step-by-step guide for community members.
* **Map:** Explore potential and existing greenway routes.
* **Get Involved:** Join the movement!
