# Welcome to the Neighborhood Greenways Project!

**Transforming our streets, connecting our communities.**

Neighborhood greenways (also called bike boulevards or neighborways) use smart design on quiet residential streets to prioritize people walking, biking, and rolling. They create safer, calmer routes connecting neighbours and destinations for **everyone**, regardless of age or ability.

**Why Create Greenways?**
Developing neighborhood greenways brings multiple benefits:
* **Enhanced Safety:** Reduces traffic speed and volume, making streets safer for all.
* **Improved Health:** Encourages physical activity and improves well-being.
* **Environmental Gains:** Offers sustainable travel options, reducing emissions.
* **Stronger Communities:** Creates more pleasant public spaces and fosters interaction.
* **Economic Vitality:** Can boost local business and property values.
