      <p>
        Neighborhood greenways, sometimes also called bicycle boulevards or neighborways, represent a transformative approach to urban street design. They prioritize the needs of <strong>pedestrians and cyclists</strong> over motorized through-traffic on local residential roads.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary aim is to create a network of connected, low-speed streets where individuals of <strong>all ages and abilities</strong> feel safe and comfortable walking, bicycling, and rolling. This is achieved by designing for lower vehicle speeds (e.g., 20 mph or less) and lower vehicle volumes (e.g., under 1,000 vehicles per day), discouraging non-local traffic while maintaining access for residents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Essentially, they re-imagine residential streets as shared spaces prioritizing people.

      <h2>Why They Matter: Key Benefits</h2>
      <p>
        Developing neighborhood greenways yields a multitude of benefits for communities and cities:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Safety Improvements:</strong> By reducing traffic speed and volume, greenways create safer conditions for everyone, especially pedestrians and cyclists. They are crucial components of Safe Routes to School and contribute to Vision Zero goals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Health Benefits:</strong> They provide safe and attractive routes that encourage physical activity (walking, biking), reduce stress, improve mental well-being, and help combat chronic diseases.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Environmental Impacts:</strong> Offering appealing alternatives to driving reduces car trips, lowering air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. They also offer opportunities for green infrastructure like trees and rain gardens.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Community Building & Livability:</strong> Calmer, quieter streets foster social interaction and strengthen community bonds. Placemaking elements like art and seating enhance neighborhood identity and pride.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Economic Benefits:</strong> Greenways can positively impact property values, attract spending at local businesses, and reduce transportation costs for residents.
        </li>
      </ul>
